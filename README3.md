# Errror Handling
- What is `Middleware` in the server side
    - It is used to manage the Http errors. So, instead of error handling of Http request in different pages, so it handles the error exception in a single page of `Middleware`. 
    - It is also good to manage errors in production mode to produce less (only single line) of code.  
- What is `Interceptor` in the client side
    - It is used to manage the Http request and responces in a single page. 
    - As an example `Not-found error` should be directed to the Not found page.
